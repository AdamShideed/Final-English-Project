										<h1>On the Importance of Purpose in Survival. </h1>

										<p>"A man without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder –– a waif, a nothing, a no-man." ––Thomas Carlyle.<br>
												<br> In order to accomplish much, one needs a purpose, lest they wander blindly. Although the need for a purpose applies to most things, purpose in the context of survival will be covered, and more importantly, why it is a necessity. </p>

												<p><br><br><br></p>
												<h2>Why Is a Purpose Critical to Survival?</h2>
												<p>Simply put, in as desperate of a time as survival, a purpose will provide the will to not give up; to not give in to the pain; to not lay down and accept fate. </P>
												<p>A strong purpose will spur someone to go through unimaginable hardships for their purpose. This purpose could be loved ones, a cause,    honour, or anything deemed worthy.</p>
												<p>As Henry Bennett, survivor of the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami puts it:</p>
												<h1>"</h1>
												<p>   I was really ready to give up and submit [to the Tsunami]. But the   thought of my family, 	 and how I needed to find them all, kept me going.   I was determined, and had a purpose</p>
												<h1>                                                   "</h1>
												<code>   <b>* This is a made-up quote, this was not in the movie nor did the real father say     anything 	  like this.</b>
												</code>


												<p>
													<br>
														<br>The importance of purpose is illustrated  from the above quote by Henry Benett, a man who, through his direct actions, made sure his whole family survived through one of the worst natural disasters in recent history.</p>
														<p>There were many points through his journey where he easily could have succumbed, but no, he carried on for his loved ones, and achieved the impossible. </p>


														<h2>What Can Having a Purpose Do For You?</h2>
														<h1>"</h1>
														<p>  Before I went into the woods, I was an afraid little girl. But during the   time I was out there, I regained my courage. I had to protect the ones I   loved and cherished. I found my courage and will to survive from my   purpose, to protect the ones I loved.</p>
														<h1>                                                   "</h1>
														<p>The above quote is from Sloan Reilly, a 12 year old girl who survived multiple days in the harsh Alaskan forest amid constant (alleged) wolf attacks. This little girl, who was known for being chronically afraid of everything, was able to survive and fend off daily wolf-attacks that left all but three of her crew killed  because she had a purpose, she couldn't let herself die and leave her friends by themselves.    </p>

														<p>No matter how bleak the situation is, like in Sloan Reilly's case, having a purpose to fall back on will allow anybody to get through anything.</p>

														<br>
														<br>
														<h2>Conclusion</h2>
														<p>	This article has been focusing on the survival benefits of having a strong purpose, but having a purpose also applies to every part of life. It is infinitely easier to convince yourself to do anything if you have a strong reason. 	</p>

														<h1>"</h1>
														<p>“It's easy to get all to wrapped up into things that may or may not happen, like disasters or doomsday, but remember to think of how you can take what you are so wrapped up about, and expand it to normal-life things.”</p>
														<h1>                                                   "</h1>
